The E-Voting System is a secure and user-friendly web-based application designed to modernize and streamline the voting process within organizations and educational institutions. Developed using Spring Boot, Spring Security, Thymeleaf, and MySQL, the system ensures transparency, fairness, and controlled voting through authenticated access and role-based authorization.

Voters can register, log in, view candidates, and cast their vote only once, with all voting activity securely recorded in the database. Administrators have access to a dedicated dashboard where they can manage candidates, oversee election activity, and view the vote counts in real time.

Overall, the system provides an efficient, scalable, and reliable digital platform that eliminates manual errors, reduces administrative workload, and enhances the overall integrity of the voting process.
